# gnome-asdbctl-slider

Want to change the brightness of your Apple Studio Display from the Gnome quick settings? look no further!

This is a simple (and I mean REAL simple) gnome slider that piggybacks off asdbctl (https://github.com/juliuszint/asdbctl) which needs to be installed in your path somewhere. Note this needs the [version](https://github.com/juliuszint/asdbctl/pull/6) of asdbctl that doesn't require sudo. This extension is very lazy it fits my need but will probably cause vomiting in any reasonable developer if you look at the code (sorry!).
